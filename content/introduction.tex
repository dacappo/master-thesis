\section{Contributions}

The main contributions of this thesis about NoSQL application security are:
\begin{description}
\item [Injection Attacks] are not a database oder application layer specific problem. Therefore, this thesis reveals new injection vectors for multiple NoSQL databases in combination with common application layers. With this broad range of investigated databases, it is shown that NoSQL injection is a general issue.
\item [Attacker Models] do not always equal the existing SQL injection attacker model. Since NoSQL databases are created to handle huge amounts of unstrucuted data from several sources, restrictions are low. These circumstances may allow the insertion of user controlled data in the import process. On account of this, an additonal attacker model is introduced to cover these new conditions.
\item [Injection Prevention] is hard to ensure, since the data and therefore the requests assume various shapes. In order to reduce the risk of injection attacks, this thesis breaks down known injection vetors to the underlying design problem. On basis of this a new database driver design is presented, that is resitent to known injection attacks.
