\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

\section{Motivation}
- Trend to big data from several sources on 
- solutions for distributed databases given with new generation of NoSQL databases
- widespread in current application stacks (on the rise)
- but new concept and therefore SQL injection is not really considered
- diaspora shows that injection is real, but not not really addressed
- many different query methods
- Is there a general NoSQL injection problematic or not

\section{Objective}

- So far only single injection vectors are published for designated NoSQL database and application layer combinations
- wider view on the NoSQL database landscape regarding injection attacks
- see if injection is a general problem for NoSQL databases across platforms
- 


\section{Contributions}

The main contributions of this thesis concerning NoSQL application security are:
\begin{description}
\item [Injection Attacks] NoSQL injection vulnerabilities are not a database oder application layer specific problem. Therefore, this thesis reveals new injection vectors for multiple NoSQL databases in combination with common application layers. With this broad range of investigated technology stacks, it is shown, that NoSQL injection is a general issue across non-relational databases.
\item [Attacker Models] Despite parallels to SQL injection attacks, the existing attacker models are not sufficient considering NoSQL injection. Since NoSQL databases are created with the aim to handle huge amounts of unstructured data from several sources, format restrictions are low. These circumstances may allow insertions of attacker controlled data from external sources. On account of this, an additional attacker model is introduced and exemplary attacks are presented to cover these new conditions.
\item [Injection Prevention] The mitigation of NoSQL injection is hard to ensure, since the data and therefore the requests assume various shapes across databases. In order to reduce the risk of injection attacks, this thesis breaks down known injection vectors to the underlying design problems. On basis of these a new database driver design is presented, that is resistant to known injection attacks.

\section{Structure}
This thesis is  structured as follows: In Chapter 2 an overview of fundamental technologies of the thesis is given. Used protocols, investigated databases and the necessary security topics are outlined in this part. Chapter 3 gives an introduction to the concept of NoSQL injection as well as corresponding attacker models. Subsequently, the in scope of this thesis discovered injection vectors are presented in chapter 4. A diverse technology stacks are addressed in this part. Chapter 5 classifies the found attack vectors based on their underlying problem. Based on this classification, chapter 6 presents a new approach for NoSQL injection mitigation. Within chapter 7 the presented solution is evaluated with real world applications. A comparison of this thesis to related publications is given in chapter 8. The last part, chapter 9, discusses the results of this work and gives a potential outlook for future work on the subject of NoSQL injection.
