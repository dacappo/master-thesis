\chapter{NoSQL Injection Mitigation}
Within this section, a mitigation approach for injection attack against non-relational databases is presented. Based on the previous attack analysis and classification, a new prevention concept is elaborated addressing the major design problems. Further, a feasible way for the implementation of the presented mitigation technique is outlined and empirically evaluated.
